Due to OGU updates, buttons look like text. Just click the text and it should wok like before.

Note: If the exension is refreshing continuously, disable it:
  - Make sure that you are logged in.
  - If you are already logged in and it is still refreshing, it will not work on your device.

Installation:
- Download and Unzip folder
- Go to "chrome://extensions/"
- Enable "Developer Mode" (Top Right)
- Click "Load Unpacked"
- Select the unzipped folder
- Disable "Developer Mode"
- Go to "https://ogu.gg/"

- Go to "https://ogu.gg/"
- Click "Key" (Top Right)

Usage:
- Go to "https://ogu.gg/newpoints.php?action=autobump" (this tab needs to be left open for the bumper to work.)
- Go to a active thread on another tab
- Click "Bump"/"Stop Bump" (Top Right) and enter a bump message
- That's it!
- You can autobump as many threads as you like but more than 10 is considered spamming and can get you a warning.
